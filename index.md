##Description

The project uses an STM32F401RE microcontroller as its core component, a TFT screen for display output, and a PS2-style joystick to control the snake. The main objective of the game is to achieve the highest score by eating apples

##Motivation

Playing games from a young age inspired me to create something new in the gaming industry. However, without formal training and experience, that goal felt out of reach. After building several smaller console-based indie games, I decided to use this capstone project to create my own version of the classic game Snake. While the game mechanics are simple, it remains engaging to play and allowed me to work with a variety of Rust crates
